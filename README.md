# Gary Bot
A simple bot to automate your own PC by simulating keyboard and mouse inputs. Capable of being expanded with custom schedules, tasks and AI integration (such as image recognition) for advanced automation.

## Possible use cases
1. Automating responses without relying on a server or paid service
2. Scheduling and deploying automated builds of software (e.g. nightly builds or experimental branches)
3. Automating monotonous tasks that require little to no human input
4. Interacting with services that have no proper API
5. Entertainment (pranks, performing tedious tasks in games, etc.)
6. Creating desktop shortcuts to open and set up multiple programs at once

## Usage instructions
This project is very early and not ready for release. If you want to use it, you must download the source yourself, create your own schedule, and enable it in the console project by inserting it into the main Program.cs file.
Then, you can build the project and simply launch the .exe file. You will be prompted to fill out required dependencies before you can start the schedule.
